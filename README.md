# The-Greatest-Colleges-of-the-Super-Bowl
## Objective
To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of
an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.
## Context
For this Achievement, you’ll select your own data to analyze. You’ll first conduct an exploratory visual
analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then,
after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them
before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.
Data dashboards are an effective tool for presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. Your
dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and should contain a curation of the key results
you discovered throughout this Achievement. Not all of your results will fit into the dashboard—make
sure to include any additional analyses you conducted in a GitHub repository.
## Data Requirements
Your chosen data must meet specific criteria so that you can conduct the procedures explored in this
Achievement (and develop the necessary skills for a junior analyst). You’ll likely need to source
multiple data sets while working through the Achievement; however, we advise you to start with one
main data set. Keep in mind that data sourcing can be very time-consuming!
The data set(s) you choose must:

#### ● Be open source
#### ● Come from an authentic/authoritative source
#### ● Include non-anonymized column names
#### ● Be no more than 3 years old (up to a maximum of 10 years if you’ve found a perfect data set for your needs and no newer data is available)
#### ● Contain at least 2 continuous variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.)
#### ● Contain at least 2 categorical variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.)
#### ● Contain at least 1,500 rows
#### ● Include a geographical component with at least 2 different values (e.g., countries, continents, U.S. states, cities, latitude and longitude values—anything you can visualize on a map!)


### Source
This is an external data source downloaded from www.sports-reference.com, a website dedicated to providing easy to understand and accessible sports statistics. The data they provide is provided by and owned by Sportradar Group AG, a “leading global sports technology company creating immersive experiences for sports fans and bettors.” Partners and clients of Sportradar include major sports, media and betting organizations (e.g., NBA, ESPN, Fanduel). Based on affiliations and breadth of data, they can be considered trustworthy. 
 
### Collection Method
This is observation data at best, but the collection and reporting process is universally accepted. Every professional sporting event, specifically NFL games, have every possible statistic recorded and verified to be able to keep track of league and team leaders, which determines the end of season champions. Furthermore, these statistics are used by all betting agencies (a multibillion-dollar industry) so you can be sure that this info is accurate and considered official.  
 
As older statistics remain unchanged, they are used as historical fact, however, new statistics are added every day, so the operation is always fresh and relevant.  
 
### Data Contents 
#### •	Team Rosters: Contains player name, no., age, position, games played in season, games started in season, weight, height, college, dob, years active, in-house player rating, draft information 
#### •	Offensive Stats: Each players passing, rushing and receiving stats for that Super Bowl game (completions, yards, touchdowns, receptions, fumbles…) 
#### •	Defensive Stats: Each players defensive stats for that Super Bowl game (interceptions, yards, touchdowns, sacks, forced fumbles…) 
#### •	Kick/Punt Returns: Each player’s kick/punt return stats for that Super Bowl game (no. of returns, total yards, yards per return, touchdowns…) 
#### •	Kicking & Punting: Each players kicking and punting stats for that Super Bowl game (extra points made, field goals made, no. of punts, total punt yards, yards per punt…) 
 
I’ve chosen this data for several reasons. First, Super Bowl 58 just happened so it’s current and relatable. Secondly, I’ve always had a passion for football and even more recently, so has my son, so I have a personal connection to this project. Finally, as this will be part of my portfolio, and seen by recruiters, sports, especially football, is a widely loved subject. 

## Fun Facts
#### •	4,506 players have been in a Super Bowl 
#### •	Ave. age of player is 27
